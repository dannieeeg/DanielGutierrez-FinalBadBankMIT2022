# DGUTIERREZ-MIT-FINAL
my final capstone bad bank project for the MITXPRO Full Stack Development program

## DESCRIPTION
This project has been a long time time coming. It has taken me quite some time to wrap my head around react and javascript in it's entirety but with help from the cohort and batchmates from MIT's program. I have built a program that is a replication of a banking application that allows registration and login. Users with accounts are able to see their transaction information.
As part of the back end, the app uses Express and MongoDB for storage.

## STRETCH GOALS 

In the future I would like to add solidity and the PLAID api so users can connect to their current bank.


## NPM INSTALL

clone the product into your local machine and run npm install in the server and ui-client directories.

follow with npm start



### **_For the client:_**

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### **_For the server:_**

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `node index.js`
